# PDF_DARKMODE

PDF_DARKMODE is a Python-based tool that allows you to convert PDFs to a dark mode theme for easier reading in low-light conditions. Simply drag and drop a PDF file into the interface to instantly apply the dark mode effect.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `PyPDF2`
  - `Pillow`
  - `tkinter`

These libraries can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install PyPDF2 Pillow
```

> `tkinter` is typically included with Python, but if it's not installed, you can get it by following the installation instructions for your OS.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDF_DARKMODE.git
   cd PDF_DARKMODE
   ```

2. Run the GUI:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Once the application opens, simply **drag and drop** a PDF file onto the window.

4. The tool will apply the dark mode effect and show the updated PDF.
